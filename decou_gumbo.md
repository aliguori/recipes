Chicken & Sausage Gumbo
=======================

ROUX
----
With large cooking spoon scoop 6 heaping spoonfuls of flour into heavy skillet.
Add about a cup of oil (or use grease skimmed from a previous gumbo) until you
have a thick paste.  Cook and stir on low heat until it is a rich chocolate
color, about 45 minutes to 1 1/2 hours.  If it turns black or begins to smell
burnt, throw it away and start over.

When it has reached the right color, remove any oil floating on the top.  Add a
little water and simmer uncovered for 1 1/2-2 hours.  This batch is enough to
make several gumbos.  Store cooked roux with a little oil on top in the
refridgerator.  Can also be frozen indefinitely.

GUMBO
-----
Put an inch of water in large deep pot.  Add about two cups of cooked roux.
Cook and stir, adding more roux if needed, until it is a rich brown color.  It
has a tendency to stick to the bottom.

Place 3 banana peppers (with seeds in) and 1 1/2 onions in food processor with a
little water.  Puree and add to gumbo.  Also add 3 heaping tablespoons of dried
parsely flakes, about a cup of green onion tops, 1 1/2 tablespoons of salt, and
cayenee to taste.  If the peppers are hot, cayenne may not be needed.  Cook for
about 20 minutes.

Add a good quality smoked beef or pork sausage, a large cut-up chicken, and
extra chicken drumsticks.  Turkey necks also make a good gumbo.  Add more water,
partially cover, and cook on low until chicken is done.  Skim gumbo as it cooks.

If adding two chickens, use 4 cups of roux.  Starting from scratch, gumbo takes
about six hours to make.
